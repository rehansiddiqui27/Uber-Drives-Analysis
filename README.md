## 𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞’𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐬𝐞𝐭 𝐨𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐰𝐞𝐫:
1️⃣ What were the unique start and stop points? 📍
2️⃣ Which routes were the most popular? 🌐
3️⃣ How does the travel purpose impact average speed? 🛣️
4️⃣ What’s the average speed by trip category? ⚡

## 𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐈 𝐓𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐥𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐬:
After loading the data, I jumped into 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 🧽! I had to extract dates, format timestamps, and ensure everything was structured for analysis. Some of my key steps:

- Extracted 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡, 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫 from the start date column 🗓️ using Excel’s text functions.

- Converted messy date-time formats using the "data tools" function (the hidden trick behind clearer insights!).

- Calculated 𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬 between start and stop times to see travel duration and speeds 🚀.

- Created 𝐩𝐢𝐯𝐨𝐭 𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐬 to make visual sense of start/stop points, travel purpose, and other trends!


## 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 🔍
- Most common travel purpose? 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠! 🏢 It was interesting to see how many riders used Uber to get to work—highlighting the importance of reliable transport for daily routines.

- 𝐀𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐬 came out at around 58 mph, giving a glimpse into travel conditions and peak times.

For the visuals, I built some easy-to-interpret 𝐩𝐢𝐯𝐨𝐭 𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬 showing each metric clearly. 🚀 This analysis was a mix of data crunching and visualization, bringing out trends that tell the story behind Uber rides.
